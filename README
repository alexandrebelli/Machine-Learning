It is an example of Machine learning.

I selected the monthly rain gauge accumulation data fro Seattle.
	
	https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/observed-monthly-rain-gauge-accumulations

I try to answer the following question:

	How can we predict the rain accumulation for a particular gauge in Seattle if we just have a fraction of the data for this specific gauge?	

The code is presented in a Jupiter Notebook.

Questions?
